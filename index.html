            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi, I'm Sevanth, a third-year B.Tech student majoring in CSE at KLU. My enthusiasm for technology and innovation drives me to refine my skills in web development and software engineering. Over the past few years, I've gained hands-on experience through various projects and internships, helping me build a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other modern web technologies.
                <br /><br />I am particularly passionate about developing user-friendly and responsive web applications that address real-world issues. My coursework and practical projects have given me a comprehensive understanding of the software development lifecycle, from initial design to deployment. I thrive in collaborative environments and enjoy working with teams to bring creative solutions to life.
                
                <br /><br />Beyond coding, I love exploring new technologies, participating in hackathons, and contributing to open-source projects. I am constantly seeking opportunities to learn and tackle new challenges that expand my knowledge and skills.
                
                <br /><br />Feel free to explore my portfolio to see some of the projects I've worked on and learn more about my journey in the tech world. If you'd like to get in touch, don't hesitate to reach out through the contact section below.</p>  </div>
